In structs.rs, make a public tuple struct named Cords with two fields,
each of type pub usize.

Note that you've probably only been exposed to Named-Field Structs so far
like:

pub struct Sandwich {
		pub name: String,
		pub price: f32,
		pub is_toasted: bool,
}

There are multiple types of structs. Read about them here:

https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch05-01-defining-structs.html

Create a derive attribute to implement Clone, Copy, Eq, Hash, and PartialEq
on Cords.

Create a public struct called Timer and a impl block for Timer.

OA:

#[derive(Clone, Copy, Eq, Hash, PartialEq)]
pub struct Cords(pub usize, pub usize);

pub struct Timer {};

impl Timer {}
