In structs.rs, make a public tuple struct named Cords with two fields,
each of type pub usize.

Note that you've probably only been exposed to Named-Field Structs so far
like:

pub struct Sandwich {
		pub name: String,
		pub price: f32,
		pub is_toasted: bool,
}

There are multiple types of structs. Read about them here:
