# Understanding Crossterm for Terminal Control

In this task, we'll explore Crossterm, a crate for terminal manipulation in Rust.

## What is Crossterm?

Crossterm is a cross-platform terminal manipulation library that provides functionality for:

- Moving the cursor around the terminal.
- Styling text with colors and attributes.
- Managing terminal modes.
- Handling terminal events like keypresses.
- And much more!

## Why use Crossterm?

Unlike other terminal libraries, Crossterm works across Windows, macOS, and Linux without any platform-specific
dependencies. This makes it ideal for creating cross-platform terminal applications.

## Let's examine how to use Crossterm for cursor positioning:

First, we need to add Crossterm to our dependencies in `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
crossterm = "0.26"
```

Then, in our code, we import the necessary components:

```rust
use std::io::stdout;
use crossterm::cursor::MoveTo;
use crossterm::execute;
```

To position the cursor at a specific location (column, row), we use:

```rust
execute!(stdout(), MoveTo(column, row)).unwrap();
```

This function call:

- Uses the `execute!` macro from Crossterm.
- Passes a reference to the standard output using `stdout()`.
- Moves the cursor to the specified coordinates with `MoveTo(column, row)`.
- Uses `unwrap()` to handle any potential errors (in a production app, you'd want proper error handling).

Remember: Terminal coordinates start at `(0,0)` in the top-left corner, with `x` increasing to the right and `y`
increasing downward.
