# Task 26

In player.rs, make a field for the KeyReader struct named `jh`. This
field holds a handle to an asynchronous task responsible for retrieving keys.
The handle is an Option type that may either contain the task (`tokio::task::JoinHandle<Key>`)
or `None`, indicating no task is currently running.
