# Task14

In structs.rs, create a new associated funtion (a constructor) named `new`,
that has one input param named `interval` of type `u64`. 

What type should `new` return? Yep, you guessed it...

Within the body of `new`, return an instance of Timer with `current_time`
set to `0`.

Close out `new`.
