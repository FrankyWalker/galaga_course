# Task 24

In player.rs, create a Player method named `respawn` that has an input parameter 
`can_respawn` which is a bool type.

This method performs the following actions:

- Checks if the entity does not have a current position (`current_position.is_none()`).
- Checks if the entity's death timer has ticked (`death_timer.tick()`).
- If both conditions are true and `can_respawn` is true, moves the entity to its starting position
(`start_position`).
