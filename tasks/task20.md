# Task20

In player.rs, create a constructor associated function for the struct Player. This functions
job is to initialize a new Player entity with default settings, like at the beginning
of a game. Begin the body of the function by declaring the var `start_position` and 
binding it to 

`Cords(ROWS - 2, COLUMNS / 2);`

This positions the player at the bottom center of the screen.

Still within the same function, write

`Player {`

and define the fields as you choose.
