Before you begin writing code, describe Galaga in detail. This will help
you begin understanding the different systems you'll need to create and
how they interact with one another. 

For example, if I were to describe Frogger, I would say it's a two dimen-
sional game on a rectangular gameboard. The goal is to navigate a frog 
controleld by the player across various rows of hazards like moving cars
and floating logs. The gameboard could be described as a series of rows
stacked on top of one another. Each space, or tile, the frog could move 
to could be described as a series of coordinates. Since the gameboard is
a rectangle, an x,y grid pattern naturally would work for helping us keep
track of the position of the frog, and the other objects.

I could continue to describe Frogger in detail, but for brevity, that is
enough.

Your first task is describe in detail the game of Galaga in perhaps more
detail than you think is necessary.
