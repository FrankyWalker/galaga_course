# Game State Implementation

In `game_state.rs`, we implement the main game loop with an asynchronous function that controls the game flow:

```rust
pub async fn start_game(&mut self) -> Result<(), String> {
    loop {
        thread::sleep(Duration::from_millis(10));
        self.display_board();
    }
    Ok(())
}
```

## Explanation

This function implements the main game logic that runs continuously until the game ends:

- It's declared as `async` to support asynchronous operations
- It takes a mutable reference to `self` (`&mut self`) to modify the game state
- It returns a `Result<(), String>` where:
    - `Ok(())` represents successful completion (with the Unit type `()`)
    - `Err(String)` represents failure with an error message

The function uses a `loop` control-flow construct to run code continuously. Within the loop:
1. The thread sleeps for 10 milliseconds using `thread::sleep(Duration::from_millis(10))`
2. The game board is displayed using `self.display_board()`

Note that this implementation creates an infinite loop that will never reach the `Ok(())` statement. In a complete implementation, you would need to add a condition to break out of the loop when the game should end.

## Asynchronous Programming

In synchronous code, operations happen sequentially (Function1 → Function2 → Function3). If Function2 takes time to complete, the entire program must wait.

Asynchronous code allows non-blocking operations. Instead of Function2 holding up the program, it can run when ready (e.g., when player input is received) while the program continues with other functions.

This is particularly important in games where you need to maintain continuous execution for animations, enemy movements, and other game mechanics regardless of user input timing.
