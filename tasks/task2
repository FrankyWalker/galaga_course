Create another file within the src directory called game_state.rs. 

We don't write all of our code in main.rs because it would be overwhelming.
It's is preferred to seperate out the major logic of the codebase into
seperate files, and then tie said logic into main. These seperate files
are called modules.

This means, suprisingly, that while the total LoC (lines of code) could be
1000+ across the codebase, main.rs would be succint at ~30.
