Create three constants at the top of your structs.rs file.

The first constant will be called SIZE and will be a usize bound to 10.

The second constant will be called ROWS and will be a usize bound to SIZE.

The third constant will be called COLUMNS, will be a usize and equal to
SIZE * 2.

NOTE: the pub keyword allows us to use code between modules.

//Game board dimensions that go inside struct.rs
pub const SIZE: usize = 10;
pub const ROWS: usize = SIZE;
pub const COLUMNS: usize = SIZE * 2;
